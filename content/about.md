I'm a 28 year old web developer from Romania, Cluj Napoca. 

My current job is a WordPress Developer @Fortech Cluj. I have experience in javascript, php, mysql, linux (ubuntu and CentOS), jQuery, WordPress, CSS, LESS, SASS, WP-CLI. I'm currently studying GoLang Development in my free time.

I like riding my bike, singing on the guitar and having interesting (what I find to be) conversations with interesting(that I find to be) people.
