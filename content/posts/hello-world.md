### What?
Hello Dog is the new Hello World. This is my blog and this is obviously the first post. I am GOing to try and document some stuff here, mostly technical, about my findings, things that I try not to forget. Ever.

### Hi there!

Welcome to my blog. This is a totally new direction that I am trying to GO in with my website and I'm trying out something new. 


This Theme may look like a ghost theme, but this is actually HTML, Generated with Hugo https://gohugo.io,  hosted on Amazon S3. Nothing too special if you know what I'm talking about.


I'm going to try to play with hugo while maintaining this blog. Right now it's the ghost theme. In the future, we shall see. 

Anyway, apparently the text is markdown, all of this is markdown. Here's a markdown cheetsheet https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet This might be useful later

### Todo's

I want to try and accomplish something with this website, and that is, like I said above, documenting and posting updates on how certain stuff is done, tutorials, etc.

Here's a list of stuff I want to post in the near future.

* Installing GO
* Installing Hugo
* Running Hugo (golang) - (a deeper look, more explanations)
* Developing in go, Basics
* Creating menus in Hug
